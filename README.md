# Analytic-Dashboard - DBA

The repository wil be divided into 4 parts:
- Backend folder
- Frontend folder
- Data folder
- Sources (Such as photos, elements, raw file, etc)

This is to ensure our files to be organized and neatly as we can and avoid 
trouble of not being able to find the source or directory.
